## Analysis
### Overview
In the new analysis we used city type data to find how the fares differ between urban, suburban, and rural cities.

### Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
According to the data collected in 2019, different types of cities follow some similar patterns in their increase and decrease of fares. The peak time for all cities is near the end of February. Even with the similarities, there is still gaps between the fare prices in each city type.
As we can see below, fare for rural cities tend to stay within $0-$500, suburban fares are usually between $750-$1,500, and urban city fares are mostly between $2,000-$2,500, with the exception of a drop of about $500 at the beginning of the year.
