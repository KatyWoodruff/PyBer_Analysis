# PyBer City Data

## Analysis
### Overview
In the new analysis we used city type data to find how the fares differ between urban, suburban, and rural cities.

## Results
According to the data collected in January to April of 2019, different types of cities follow some similar patterns in their increase and decrease of fares. The peak time for all cities is near the end of February. Even with the similarities, there is still gaps between the fare prices in each city type.

### Fare Data Summary 1
As we can see below, fare for rural cities tend to stay within $0-$500, suburban fares are usually between $750-$1,500, and urban city fares are mostly between $2,000-$2,500, with the exception of a drop of about $500 at the beginning of the year.

### Fare Data Summary 2
Even though urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride, they also have the highest total fares.
here we can see that the higher the average fare per ride, the lower the total fares are.

### Summary
Based on the results of this analysis,  advise that potentially lowering the average fare price in rural and suburban cities could increase the amount of total rides and therefore increase the total fares for those cities.
I would also recommend a further look into the time of day data, to look for trends that could help to boost total ride count in the rural and suburban cities.
Lastly, a decrease in fare prices in rural cities could encourage drivers and customers to accept more rides.
